# Concurrency examples in Python and Go

This is a really simple test project to demonstrate some basic concurrency principles in which Python and Go differ. These snippets were part of a presentation, so they are not thoroughly documented or realistic.

## Python

To run the python examples, cd into the PythonConcurrency folder and run the modules.

```bash
cd PythonConcurrency
python -m concurrency.thread.single_thread
```

## Go

To run the python examples, cd into the GoConcurrency folder and run the examples defined in the cmd library.

```bash
cd GoConcurrency
go run concurrency/cmd/greet
```
